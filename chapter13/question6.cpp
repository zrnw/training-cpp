/*
In designing a game, we decide we want to have monsters, because everyone likes fighting monsters. Declare a struct that represents your monster. 
The monster should have a type that can be one of the following: an ogre, a dragon, an orc, a giant spider, or a slime.

Each individual monster should also have a name (use a std::string or std::string_view), 
as well as an amount of health that represents how much damage they can take before they die. 
Write a function named printMonster() that prints out all of the structâ€™s members. Instantiate an ogre and a slime, initialize them using an initializer list, and pass them to printMonster().

Your program should produce the following output:

This Ogre is named Torg and has 145 health.
